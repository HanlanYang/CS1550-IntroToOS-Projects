# CS 1550 â€“ Project 3: VM Simulator

## Project Description
In class, we have been discussing various page replacement algorithms that an Operating System implementer may choose to use. In this project, you will compare the results of four different algorithms on traces of memory references. While simulating an algorithm, you will collect statistics about its performance such as the number of page faults that occur and the number of dirty frames that had to be written back to disk. When you are done with your program, you will write up your results and provide a graph that compares the performance of the various algorithms.

The four algorithms for this project are: Opt, Clock, NRU, and Random.

You may write your program in C/C++, Java, Perl, or Python as long as it runs on thoth.cs.pitt.edu.

Implement a page table for a 32-bit address space. All pages will be 4KB in size. The number of frames will be a parameter to the execution of your program.
