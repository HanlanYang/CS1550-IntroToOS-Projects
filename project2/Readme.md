# CS 1550 – Project 2: Syscalls and IPC

## Project Description
We know from our description of the kernel that it provides fundamental operations that help us to interact with resources. These system calls include things like read, write, open, close, and fork. With access to the source code for the Linux kernel, we have the ability to extend the kernel’s standard functionality with our own.

We’ve also been learning about synchronization and solving the producer/consumer problem using semaphores. In this project, we will modify the Linux kernel to add our own implementations of down() and up() as system calls and then use them to solve the producer/consumer problem.
