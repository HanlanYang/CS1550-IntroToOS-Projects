# CS 1550 – Project 1: Double-Buffered Graphics Library

## Project Description
Your instructor was learning ARM assembly language over a prior summer break and was trying to make some projects for CS/COE 0447 to do. While text-based programs are okay, it’s really the graphical programs that make it a bit more interesting. So your instructor started to write a graphics library so the students could make a simple game.

In doing so, he noticed that a lot of the basic functionality the library provided was accessing the low-level operating system features that we talk about in 1550. The light bulb went off over his head, and project 1 was born.

In this project, you’ll be writing a small graphics library that can set a pixel to a particular color, draw some basic shapes, and read keypresses.
